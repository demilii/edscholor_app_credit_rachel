Even polar bears stayed away.</p><p>But Henson was excited. He knew he was just days from achieving his dream. He wanted to be one of the first people to reach the North Pole.</p><p>Henson put his head down and pushed forward against the wind. Suddenly, he lost his balance. The ice beneath his feet cracked. He fell into the frigid ocean.</p><p>Henson had spent nearly 20 years of his life trying to get to the North Pole.</p><p>And now it seemed it would all end right here.</p>",

Just when it seems like it’s going to disappear beyond the horizon, it climbs back up. Why does this happen?</p><p>It has to do with the angle of our planet. Every 24 hours, Earth rotates on its axis. The side that faces the sun experiences daylight. For the side that’s facing away from the sun, it’s night. But Earth is not perfectly straight—it’s tilted.And during the summer months, the top of Earth is tilted toward the sun. So for areas above or near the Arctic Circle, the sun is pointed at them all day long.</p><p>Of course, it’s not all sunshine. In the winter months, the top of Earth is tilted away from the sun. That means in places with the midnight sun, daytime is very short in the winter. In some spots, the sun doesn’t come up for months.</p>",
